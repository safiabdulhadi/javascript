/* Code structure
The first thing we’ll study is the building blocks of code.

Statements
Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.

We’ve already seen a statement, alert('Hello, world!'), which shows the message “Hello, world!”.

We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.

For example, here we split “Hello World” into two alerts:*/
alert('Helllo');
alert('World');
